        <h2>Welcome all! I'm Diego A. Soto.</h2>
        <p>Not what you were expecting? If you're reading this, chances are you've known me for a while.</p>
        <p>On this website, you can get to know bits and piece of who I am, what I do, and how I think. That last one is the most important one.</p>
        <p>Some people told me:"Why a website?"|"Do you even know how to code?"|"Improve your resume."|"Just use GoDaddy or something"... when I told them about how I wanted to create a presence for myself front to back. A digital one that can tell my story beyond what fits on a piece of paper, while undeniably demonstrating what I can do.</p>
        <p>My Story? Well I'll start off by saying thank you to a long-time friend who helped me launch this site: bitmap.</p>
        <p>Then I could get into how this website is built on a LEMP stack (Linux, NGINX, MySQL, PHP) and how each of those work with each other to render text on your screen, how somewhere in the cloud there's a computer that can show my site to anyone with an internet connection, and how much I LOVE learning about...well everything.</p>
	<p>It doesn't end here, not even close. This is simply the beginning and I'm so excited to hit the boundaries of my abilities and go beyond. Thank you!</p>
